    Example:

    Description:
    This operator accumulates a buffer with a length enough to store
    elements count elements. Upon completion of the source sequence, this
    buffer is drained on the result sequence. This causes the elements to be
    delayed.

    :param count: Number of elements to take from the end of the source
        sequence.

    :returns: An observable sequence containing the specified number of elements
        from the end of the source sequence.
