    Example:
    res = source.take_last(5)

    Description:
    This operator accumulates a buffer with a length enough to store
    elements count elements. Upon completion of the source sequence, this
    buffer is drained on the result sequence. This causes the elements to be
    delayed.

    Keyword arguments:
    count -- Number of elements to take from the end of the source
        sequence.

    Returns: An observable sequence containing a single list with the specified
    number of elements from the end of the source sequence.
